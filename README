# Reddit Sentiment Project

This is a machine learning project designed to take Reddit comments, classify them based off sentiment, and provide an overall "score" to Reddit topics (albums currently).

The learning is wrapped in a web application designed to give the user a pleasant UI when traversing through different Reddit topics.

The technologies/tools used in this project are React, Flask, mySQL TensorFlow, Keras, the Reddit API PRAW, and Python.
## Code
The React application code can be located in redditsentiment/redditsent_application/reddit-sentiment/

The Flask application code can be located in redditsentiment/flask_application/

The machine learning code and our models can be located in the redditsentiment/ root and redditsentiment/savedmodels.
## Still To Do
1. Refactor code structure to make more hierarchical sense
2. Build out the Flask backend 
3. Connect Flask backend with React frontend using a REST API
4. Update React UI to look cleaner
