For those complaining about merch
Ye wasnt available until around 12PST on June 1st
So give it some time
Ye wasnt available on streaming until after 8 PST
This isnt uncommon just be patient

Yo. Anyone else notice that Ghosttown was also listed on the Kids See Ghosts [tracklist](https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/kids-see-ghosts-tracklist/) he posted like 2 weeks ago? Number 4. 


I wonder if he jacked it cus he didnt have enough for this album or if kids is so full they needed to bump something album worthy.

Wrapping up my fourth listen, and I think its probably Kanyes worst album. Its not terrible or anything, but it just feels lacking. 

There are definitely good songs. But the beats and backing vocals are better than pretty much anything Kanye raps. I know that can be the case for other Kanye stuff, but the difference is starker on Ye. 

Sometimes it sounds like he took elements of TLOP and just kinda made them more boring. Or maybe they seem boring because I listened to TLOP so much. 

There isnt one song I think is garbage; I like something in pretty much all of them. But at the same time, there isnt one song Ive listened to that clicked and I just thought Holy shit! Thats amazing! 

Id give it about 6.5. Above average for anyone else, below average for Kanye.

That shit on the last track goddamn. Alright now that i've listened to the whole thing, It's fucking good. Just like Carter 3 and 4 there's a little bit for everyone here. Lots of spitting, but also lots of melodic and pop  shit too. It's a little long but honestly only by like 3 tracks. Overall I feel a solid 8/10. great great great album for Wayne to release especially with all the hype

Ahhhh man I REALLY want some Live.Love.ASAP type stuff from Rocky again. I'm about halfway thru TESTING and so far pretty disappointed. I mean there are plenty solid bangers for the car on here, but that's about it (so far). PLEASE someone tell me there's some Clams-type shit on here, something like Wassup maybe. I really miss the atmosphere and flows Rocky churned out circa 2012.

- Instrumentals are fire as always. Top to bottom. 

- Really fucking with the first two tracks. Definitely was hitting on that therapeutic vibe that he mentioned in the Charlamagne interview.

- 'Wouldn't Leave' is probably the weakest point for me. I've listed to the album 5-10 times since the initial stream and that track is already an automatic skip for me. Not that it's a bad song per se, just not my cup of tea at all.

-  Charlie Wilson killed the hook on 'No Mistakes', though I wish there was another verse from Ye. The Slick Rick sample just adds a whole new dimension to the song.

- 070 Shake stole the show on 'Ghost Town'. Probably my favorite feature on the whole project. The rest of the track is kind of forgettable compared to the end.

- I'm not a huge fan of 'Violent Crimes' but I think they definitely executed on the idea of the song very well. The voice mail from Nicki at the end was kind of cool.

- Was expecting more actual rapping. Again, he alluded to 'Real Friends' as the type of vibe they would be hitting on this album...kind of got that musically, but it's certainly not that from a rapping standpoint.

Still enjoyed DAYTONA a lot more, but this is a solid album. Kanye really had to thread the needle with this one...barely any room for error on a seven track album. It's kind of all over the place but I suppose that's to be expected given all of themes/ideas he was trying to hit on, dealing with mental illness, his recent antics, etc.

After my first listen I'm not really digging it.  The first 5 or so songs are easily the best songs then it falls off hard.  Too many songs trying to do the LSD thing and not quite landing.  Hopefully the album grows on me.  Rocky's best project was his first and it looks like that's not going to change.

 *Disclaimer, this is just my opinion. Ive enjoyed reading different perspectives on this thread, this is just my humble opinion.* 

With how much Kanye evolves with each album, I tend to go into each album not expecting a certain sound or characteristic \(great lyricism / political rap / etc\) but I tend to go expecting a cohesive artistic work, and enjoy the experience as a whole. 

This album makes me so damn happy, man. I mean as a Kanye fan who wanted him to get better after his breakdown and talk about his medical struggles, this \(to me\) doesnt sound like Old Kanye / New Kanye \- it just sounds like a Kanye who was found out some difficult truths about himself \(bi polar / mental struggles\), but has pushed through it, has learned to accept and love himself \- and is finding joy and positivity through just making his music. 

The album has different sounds, but one thing I felt throughout is just an undeniable joy for the gift of music. I teared up as the 808s kicked in over the moody synth / vocal effect in I thought about killing you, Yikes and All Mine are such grin inducing bops, Wouldnt leave is beautiful with how Ty Dolla, the choir and everything builds up at the end, I smiled all throughout No mistakes like damn, Charlie Wilson on that just had me grinning like an idiot. Everyones already mentioned it but Ghost Town is beautiful. Its like some hip hop / rock / futuristic mix and I love it. And Violent Crimes is a song I know Im going to think of if I have a daughter one day. That is a beautiful story and its a good perspective hearing Ye as a father \- how back when he released Only One he was so happy and in love with his daughter, but now at this point hes also struggling with the fear of how the world is going to try to take advantage of his daughter as she grows up. 

Sorry for writing so much but man Im on my 3rd listen and this album makes me happy. Politics, TMZ and all that aside; with Ye its good music as usual and I couldnt be happier.

Bad Meets Evil track pretty much guarantees it'll be better than Revival. Please redeem yourself, Em.

This album blows.

I'm a big Rocky fan but his shit is just way to experimental and mellow for my tastes. There's really not a banger like "LPFJ2, "Goldie" or "Brand New Guy" that I fuck with on here like his previous albums.

Couple that in with some off key singing, terrible pitch effects, Rocky just seems like he's trying way to hard to be artsy.

I miss his old sound on Live.Love.A$AP. His sound on there sounded like RZA/Havoc on acid. I really don't understand why he's working with producers like Delgado when he should be sticking with guys like Clams, Beautiful Lou, Ty Beats and etc. You know people that actually helped make a sound for him that created him into a star. Someone really needs to tell him how important his first tape was and why he should go back to that on his next project.

Not feeling it honestly. Songs are boring compared to 1 and 2 where they had bangers and unique sounds. This album doesn't really have that except for Boogie.

I've listened to this a few times now. It's already growing on me. I did the same with Daytona, though I liked that instantly. These 20-25 minute albums are great idea. For such works I wouldn't blame people for asking for new material sooner though.

Tried so hard to like this, especially because of how many comments I was seeing about how great it was, but it was honestly pretty disappointing to me. Production was great, kanye verses were solid, but with how abstract the concepts were for each track and just how obnoxious cudi's voice is on every track, I couldn't feel any of it. His lyrics seem pretty trash to me and he's so nasally and flat on all of his deliveries, it's painful. Never was a fan of his humming either. He really brings down the whole project for me, and his early stuff is my absolute favorite, so it's really frustrating that I can't get into whatever sound he's been rocking the past few years.

This is mid. Kanye is beyond washed now, so I'm not really having high hopes for Kids See Ghosts if this is the standard of quality he's hoping to keep. 

I liked Daytona. It's smart that he released it before. But as all things are with Kanye, the critics aren't gonna know what to do. They're afraid to be objective and afraid to look dumb. And his stans will listen to anything he puts out and pretend it's the next best thing since College Dropout. It's not, but they will lol.

Everyone hating it but Kanye stans doesn't make it "polarizing".

#SATURATION SZN 


First impressions:

BOOGIE: Wasn't feeling this when it dropped but it's so good and groovy it keeps growing on me. The gap between Merlyn's and Dom's verse is pretty substantial though.

ZIPPPER: DINGS IN THE WHIP CONFIRMED. HAHAH MERLYN JUST SHUT ME UP I LOVE IT. how are they able to write these god-tier hooks for 3 albums straight jfc

JOHNNY: someone give kevin harry style's phone number for the love of god. this beat is fucking disgusting that and random sax hnggh Joba's verse is so raw i havent seen that from him it's beautiful

LIQUID: they go from one member to the other and stay on the beat so nicely there's no drop in quality fucking hell


CINEMA 1: i can only imagine Roberto walking through the garden reflecting on his life as kevin is making out with someone

STUPID: I FEEL THE BUILD UP. I WAS RIGHT THIS IS DIGUSTING HOLY SHIT ROMIL AND JABARI ARE GODS. I need a dom solo album so badly. i wanna give kevin a hug man

BLEACH: bearface's voice is angelic. matt shines on this so hard and also you can hear the kanye influence on Merlyn's verse. this was in the short film and I think it might be my favorite bh song. YO THAT BEAT SWITCH.

ALASKA: ameer come on man dont leave loans unattended not financially sound. everyone on here is so versatile and brings something else to the table. 3 albums in and it's different styles everytime what the fuck.

HOTTIE: we just went from alaska to this pop sounding song so seamlessly lmao. ehhh it was okay.

CINEMA 2: Summer, I'm sorry.

SISTER / NATION: YEA YEA YEA. yea i can see joba in counseling. him in the freezer during the video for BOOGIE gave me "The Shinning" vibes. lmao the timing of the russell simmons line. this beat has my heart racing death by bh rip.and now this hazy, cloudy beat like going from adderall to xanax lol. the synth on this is beautiful.

RENTAL: getting some the weekend/bryson tiller vibes from this one. 

STAINS: someone said it in the other thread but if this was an ameer solo track i wouldnt be mad. as someone who just went through a breakup i feel dom's verse so hard wow im sad now

CINEMA 3: is roberto at church

TEAM: bearface's song im ready. im so happy im going to the tour because i need to feel that guitar riff at 1:15 in person. very nice way to close out the album. wait that at the end leads into HEAT. last song is called team, 4th album is called team efford :thinking: 



final thoughts (its my first listen go easy pls)

standout tracks: ZIPPER, STUPID, BLEACH (i think its my favorite song from them just so beautiful havent stoppped listening to it since the short film) U KNOW WHAT ADD JOHNNY ON THIS SHIT TOO

forgetable ones: HOTTIE, RENTAL (im on the fence about this one)

tldr: wow they done did it again, probably still need more listens before i rank it among their previous work. really good album, starts off stupidly strong and tapers off a bit towards the last 3rd or so but a good closer. 

8.5/9 out of 10

Overall thoughts after my first few listens:  i love it. this album is an incredible combination of serene and cathartic both musically and lyrically .

A mixed bag lyrically, with some really nice production to complement.

Kanye's most recent release comes just about 2 years after 2016's The Life of Pablo. This album had a very odd method of release, being streamed on an obscure live streaming app complete with video of his listening party in Wyoming where he played through the album twice. I hated it at first, which may have had something to do with the fact that I was watching it with a friend and he also didn't like it. But today I listened to the release on Spotify. And there was a lot of good, as well as a lot of bad.

The production on this album is overall really neat. It uses a lot of old soul samples (i.e. this one from Ghost Town https://youtu.be/yD442BYRT0Q). It fits the mood of the album really well in my opinion. Although I do have a gripe with how obnoxiously the Slick Rick sample is placed on No Mistakes. If you've heard it, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Other than that, though, production is really good.

Kanye himself is fine as far as flow goes. But as for lyrics, it's a mixed bag, to say the least. You go from a really interesting look into his mental state in the spoken word segment of I Thought About Killing You to the Revival-level garbage on All Mine (i.e. "I love your titties, 'cause they prove I can focus on two things at once." & "Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome, (ayy) none of us would be here without cum." To name a few.). There's a lot of that back-and-forth on this album, but when he hits, he really hits. The last track on this album, Violent Crimes legitimately made me cry when I really took time to listen to it.  So if nothing else is gained in listening to this album, we know that Kanye is still capable of making great tracks. 

Overall I'm really glad I gave this album another chance. I wish that he had been more consistent lyrically, but at least he seems to be trending in the right direction. Let's hope Kids See Ghosts and Kanye's future solo efforts turn out just as good (hopefully better).

I know the fresh release thread is for memes and shit but honestly this proves the downside of short albums to me. The main upside being the chance for no filler and all impactful songs packed into a short amount of time. However, this album has like 3 songs that are completely skippable. That's just not going to work with a 7 song album. Luckily Ye is a master beat producer and that carried this album but it still feels like we only got 3 or 4 REAL songs. The rest feel like unfinished thoughts/concepts that never got fleshed out. My personal opinion is that Kanye has his hands in too much shit right now and maybe that compromised some of these ideas. 

I'm highly disappointed in this and will pray every night this week that KSG has more attention to detail and the beautiful song progression that Ye is known for being a master at.

Final score (as if anyone cares lol) : 5/10 

or 2 scoopties/ 5 poopities.

Stargazing - boy has this song grown on me since the snippets and album trailer. Might be my favorite trav opener. Best switch was really unexpected too, thought it was a whole new track at first

Carousel - frank killed this shit. Might be my favorite feature from him. Love the beat, was surprised to see it wasnt Pierre tho

Sicko mode - love drake and swae on this. Both beats hard af no complaints 

RIP SCREW - swae feature is nice. Little too low key after the energy of the first three tracks but its still a vibe

Stop trying to be - THOSE CUDI HUMMS.  I really like the harmonica too and the James Blake bridge. Shit sounds beautiful I just wish the first half of the song lived up to the second half. Couldve used some more Cudi vocals on the bridge or something too imo 

No bystanders - was nervous about the juice wrld feature cause he can be hit or miss for me but Im glad hes kind of just doing a swae lee impersonation. Track is hard and Traviss rapping is pretty nice on here. Best change is smooth af too 

Skeletons - tame impala makes perfect demented carnival music. Trav sounding the most kanye like he has in a minute here. Weeknd and Pharrell kill it. Definetly an early favorite 

Wake up - this hook is candy. I hope they push for this to be a hit and that outro is probably my favorite on the album so far

5% tint - wasnt a huge fan of the way the sample was used at first but it grew on me and I love the wolves synths on the outro 

NC-17 - love 21s verse, especially that Cudi lone but the song feels sort of unremarkable 

Astrothunder - one of the best hooks so far. Just wish there was more to it. I wish Abel was on this too tho cause he would kill it. 

Yosemite - GOD DAMN THIS IS THE NEW OH OKAY. Gunna can be hit or miss for me but whenever hes on a turbo guitar beat its gonna be a certified smash. Not even nav can ruin this song good thing he was quite af tho

Cant stay - yup this is a wondagurl best for sure. Loving Traviss melodies here. Dont know who don toliver is but i could take or leave his part 

Who what? - ok this is the travis I was hoping we wouldnt get on this album 

Butterfly effect - still dont like this song. This and who what feel so out of place here. Wish he wouldve put on Watch instead 

Houstonfornication - hey its vacation but he changed the name to sound like that one RHCP song which works a lot better as a portmanteau but whatever. Never got the hype about this song when it leaked 

Coffee bean - this that hotel lobby shit. Another track where Travis rapping like ye. 

Overall thoughts - sounds good to hear travis sounding like hes actually trying when he raps again. Also appreciate the more ambitious production, even if it doesnt pay off as well as it does on Rodeo. The four song streak from cant stay to houstonfornication shouldnt have made the cut imo. Cant stay aint bad but seemed like it was more of a track for Don Toliver than trav and then the three tracks that followed it are that boring generic trav shit weve been getting recently. Take those tracks out and add in Watch instead and the album is a solid 8.5-9/10. As is its around an 8-8.5/10. Not as good as Rodeo or DBR but better than everything else hes done easily

Maybe a little late to the party, been listening to this on repeat all day but it's also the finals szn grind.

Possibly my favorite BH album yet. Seems like fewer standalone bangers/singles, but personally found it to a bit more cohesive and mature than S1 and S2. Romil's production is once again, as the kids say, off the shits. Really blown away even though I had such high expectations from him going in. Also though Joba shone through a lot, even though everyone is improving in leaps and bounds. Really cool to grow with a group like this. Can't wait to see the melon give out a 10.

Personal faves (sheesh, if I can only pick 3): BLEACH, STUPID (with the lead-in from CINEMA 1), STAINS.

i just finished the album. (im not a travis stan, to clarify) 

i thought overall it was a pretty hot album. that opening was fucking BONKERS. STARGAZING is one of my favorite songs on the album, a great intro. CAROUSEL was great. SICKO MODE is WOOOOOO, good shit, good drake feature, its pretty sick-o, i was vibing hard to it. R.I.P. SCREW felt kinda repetitive by the end, good song i guess. STOP TRYING TO BE GOD did disappoint a little bit, reading that name i thought this was going to be the greatest fucking song ever, its definitely still a great song but i overhyped it myself. NO BYSTANDERS IS HOTTTTT. SKELETONS is nice

at this point i started to feel like some songs got noticeably worse

WAKE UP felt kinda generic and boring to me. completely forgettable track imo. 5% TINT just felt like another forgettable track and i feel like i could only make out some words Travis was saying. NC-17 is HEAATTT. great 21 feature (nut on her face call her baby face lmao) ASTROTHUNDER felt like the same as i said for 5% TINT. YOSEMITE is bad. just bad. i feel like i couldnt hear Travis during alot of the song and the beat felt distracting with the lyrics. CANT SAY was a good song, thats that. same with WHO? WHAT!. i skipped BUTTERFLY EFFECT. HOUSTONFORNIFICATION was a pretty good song tho. and COFFEE BEAN was HOT, great outro to the album.

overall, on first listen i think i would give this album a 8.2/10. most of first half of the album was pretty good, and the last stuff was pretty good too, but I feel like the album lacked a good middle part of the album. the only songs in the middle i think i would put on a playlist are NC-17 and SKELETONS.

my favorite songs: STARGAZING, SICKO MODE, STOP TRYING TO BE GOD, NO BYSTANDERS, NC-17, COFFEE BEAN

least favorite songs: YOSEMITE, 5% TINT, WAKE UP

I've listened to it 4 times through as of now and I'm liking it more and more each time. You have to look at this project as one cohesive piece to really appreciate it. I think given the context of the past two years this the perfect album from kanye. It's a very personal album and it's really reflective of kanye right now, all down to how it was thrown together last minute. Of course the production was beautiful and I can't wait to hear the project with Cudi.

After two listens, I can say I thoroughly enjoy this. The production is crisp throughout and I feel all the features were on point. I will say the concept of "astroworld" isn't as clear to me as the concept of rodeo though, and this doesn't come close to the scale or ambition of rodeo. Still, it's a solid listen and I can't wait to digest it some more.

Fifth is my summer in a song, I can just tell this is the bake in parks song. The sixth is a symphony of a song, honestly this is the Runaway of this album, just an epic and complete song. Final song is very chance the rapper, so hopeful, its the song we want and need rn.

Honestly, as a long term fan, this album hit me hard with the feels. This album is his acceptance speech for a lifetime achievement award because only the Best Rapper Alive can call himself that. I was moved by the fact that he featured his mother, and daughter on the same album. It's so beautiful to see someone who was rapping at 9, had a daughter at 17, and dropped his own solo album a year later. He hasn't always handled the fame well, but this is the one where I feel he's matured. I could not imagine the ability to put "my mother" on a stage to tell the world she loves me, is proud of me, and worries for me. To have "my daughter" sing a song with me sharing in the career that has built everything we have... not to mention the fact that Reginae kills it her voice is heavenly. That's grown man shit. 

He said it in the announcement video he gave us more than him. I feel that. As a dedicated fan, I feel that.

 Thank you Weezy F Baby for giving all of my high school, and college years a sound track. Thank you for Fireman in particular, we banged that one at my wedding. It was dope.

And for me, this album really brought out a genuine smile and made me feel amazing when I really fucking needed it. That means more to me than a banger ever will. Nobody else has to feel the same way, but for me, stuff like this is why I stan Kanye. His music has made a profound impact in my life in some dark times, this isn't any different.

Maybe it will grow on me, but honestly most of these tracks aren't really sticking with me that much. Most of the album kinda blurs into one (not in the good way), I was really excited which might be part of why I don't like it much since my expectations were high.       

I feel as if the album's style burns out really fast and just can't really manage a 40 minute album, since on an individual level I like a fair few songs here but they are quite similar.

So far it has definitely grown on me after multiple listens, but there is clearly something missing. People here are praising the production as the best production they've ever heard... what? Some songs sound good production but others are purposely full of restraint - this clearly wasn't an album where Kanye was overly innovative or masturful in his production, he seems to play it a lot more mellow here, and that's on purpose. It's okay, we don't need to pretend it's the greatest produced thing ever. 

 Daytona had way more unique and powerful production, and I'm not just saying that because Daytona is full of bangers and Ye is more mellow. 

With rapping, some of the bars are fun but Kanye's verse on "What Would Meek Do" flows better than anything here. The album actually shines the most with the featured vocals (excluding Cudi, sadly. Just isn't real good singing). 

This all said, I really like songs 4-7 where 1-3 are more of growers. It's a pretty album with some beautiful moments. But it's held back by moments that are just plain underwhelming.

Also, the album cover? It's a straight up minions quote. And Wyoming is beautiful but the meme that he took it on his iphone isn't as impressive if it would have been a better exposed photo.

Here is my fan boy analysis

I thought about killing you: good intro track, reminiscent of TLOP, good vocals and dope switch up 

Yikes: great beat that Ye capitalizes on with hard bars, awesome track to follow up the intro. Fun, catchy hook. Felt like walking from the green room to the stage. 

All Mine: an interesting beat supported by a dope feature, Yes lyrics provide some clarity and comic relief to the heavy bass and stripped down beat. 

Wouldnt Leave: this message is funny af but the song itself is good. Solid features and hook, exultant horns and vocals. Apology track, apology bars. 

No Mistakes: super rich, luxurious hook that he strips down to give a harder feel for the bars.  Dope, standard ye bars. 

Ghost Town: sorta reminiscent of MBDTF and Yeezus. Electric guitar sample adds to the drama that Kid Cudi starts. Kanyes vocals are pretty good, provides a good contrast to Cudis drawn out voice. The bridge w the feature is dope and further adds to the epic and complex beat. The random space sounds in the background are kinda weird but ya know. 

Violent Crimes: feature is good, great exit song. Yes message is solid, bars are nice and uplifting for the end of the album. If only it was the lift yourself rework

Famous (feat. Reginae Carter)

Edit 2:

Fuck it. Album already growing in me after several tracks. C5 classic.

Eminem dissin tyler but dont realize tyler did what eminem was doing and still does (grotesque, over the top violent wordplay) better on bastard and goblin. Only difference is tyler has moved on and matured and eminem still stuck beatin that same dead horse that he has hit since the nineties. Some people just gotta learn to retire with grace or mold yourself into what people want, and the people dont want marshall.

Production is out of this world. Glad Tyler is still out there exploring ways to make music.

I feel like he named it IGOR after the assistant from Frankenstein. They brought life to this relationship but it turned out all wrong. In the Frankenstein story it was Igors fault the monster was evil because he harvested an insane persons brain instead of a normal person. I feel like Tyler blames who he is as a person for the reason the relationship wont work. He feels like if he was just normal things wouldnt of gone wrong. 

That interpretation could be completely off but to me it fits the theme and music so well when I listen.

Not feeling this as much as the previous two. Still a great album, but this just doesn't feel as memorable to me yet. Then again, I generally prefer the harder and catchier BH tracks like Heat, Gold, Star from Sat1 and Gummy, Junky, Sweet, Chick from Sat 2.

About halfway through so far, not sure how I feel.

It doesnt feel like a Lil Wayne album. I wasnt expecting Tha Carter 2/3, but I wanted to at least listen to Lil Wayne songs. This feels like someone elses album with a bunch of Lil Wayne features.

Happy for Wayne though.

First listen is that it's pretty good.

The Ringer, Greatest, Lucky You, Not Alike, Fall, and Kamikaze are all good.

Normal, Stepping Stone, Nice Guy, and Venom are bad/mediocre.

This is history for everyone one of us that calls ourselves fans of this genre, Wayne is the don

The highs of this album are vintage Wayne but theres definitely some boring or filler tracks in the middle for me. 

Overall, though, its more good than average. I dont think theres a song thats bad upon first listen. I still prefer Carter 2 and 3 but this is better than 4 for me. 

Uproar and Mona Lisa are so fucking fire.

###1###
***7446***
5% Tint is the only one that has a true Houston vibe to it (probably because the beat is a direct sample of a Lil Keke freestyle, but I digress). RIP Screw integrated the sampling too raw, in my opinion.

30 gold (as of now), really?

I'm a huge fan of him but idk...it sounds all that mumble jumble you hear on the radio now a days. Sorry but this album is not very good. Call me old fashioned but I was expecting some WAYNE yo. not this sorta-sounds-like-Migos trash. But I guess shit sells so sell that shit. 

Tin foil hat theory: He saw how much em just blew up and all that $$$ and was like "hey, I should release this shit now" 

But none of these songs even compare to his older stuff. I know times have changed but come on guys. It's kind of bad. 

edit: And literally every song, every sentence is "something something nigga."

Overall a strong 7 / light 8 project. Very solid, 2nd half bangs heavy for me. Doesnt break into Yes Top 5 or even 6 of his discography. Only because Yes Top 5 is so strong. 

Im going to enjoy this. Also because we are getting more Ye production with Nas and Teyana and another Ye album with Cudi. I will be pretty satisfied. Ye aint lost it. A true artist despite his Political views

Production is a great but some of these songs are blending together
###1###
***4416***
Damnnnnn ima jot my thoughts about this

The Ringer: pretty dope, slowish start but second half has great flows. drops bars about some of the new school, charlamane, the bet cypher this year. beat is pretty minimal but cool. never thought Id hear Eminem on a beat like this or rapping about these topics. great start and one of the best on this project.

Greatest: mike will made it production? dropped a line about it in the beginning. beat slaps. flows rampant from the start. hook is kinda weak. sounds like a light Kendrick hook. em is showing more self awareness then ever. borrows a cadence from Humble

Lucky You: Joyner is on this one, so far pretty cool. sounds like hes really trying to compete. second half of his verse is nice.
theres a break down in the middle, slows down a little. beat changes a little for Em and it fits pretty well. their styles mesh really well too actually its kinda cool. they trade off on the hook at the end and it shows. this is one of the best songs on this, nice mix of bars flows and banging beat.

Paul - Skit - Paul Rosenberg: pretty funny, throwback to his older albums. spoiler alert, Paul wasnt down with this album.

Normal: em is talking about relationships on this, kinda interesting to get a look into this side of his life. hook is kinda catchy in a weird way. really minimal beat. em be dating crazy ass chicks. beat change is cool. whole tone of the song changes up and it lowkey bops. really melodic flows from Eminem here, very different from what hes done. really a different take on his whole formula, I liked this song a lot.

Em Calls Paul - Skit: haha this skit is hilarious

Stepping Stone: this is a throwback to that era of Em when he was making songs like Mockingbird and Toy Soldier, sounds like it would fit perfectly in that era. pretty cool honestly. he talks about the past and sounds like hes getting some skeletons out of his closet.

Not Alike: the Royce feature! royce has been on one so I was pretty hyped for this. damn based on the tag the same guy made Look Alive!
Lmao, the beginning/hook is hilarious. Eminem is clowning on the flows a lot of ppl use now.
Royce is doing a similar thing where hes using a popular flow but really taking it to the next level. fire. really killed his feature. think it might have to go to Royce over Joyner.
Ems talking shits. pretty great. the last bit was pretty dope, beat changes and theres this little opera chick sample. he really is going off for two and half minutes straight lol.

Fell: damn ems flows on this are pretty dope. the hook is really okay. second time a hook on this project was really okay. but he stays flowing throughout. the beat change at the last third is dope again haha, his raps on that part are ill too. surrrprising.

Kamikaze: damn the drums are pretty crazy on this one. idk what to think of the hook, autotuned feature. miiiight be a grower? Joe Budden, Ak and Tyler got bars, they werent bad in punch factor and funny. the Budden bar is actually hilarious. Im sure ppl will talk about it regardless.

Nice Guy: the first of the two features from someone named Jessie Reyez. this is easily the best hook and beat so far. this chick is dope. brought some good shit out Eminem too. i could definitely see myself listening to this frequently. 
Might be the best song.

Good Guy: not bad, a chill closer to the first part of this. i could imagine others liking this but its not my style. really chill.

Venom: meh, I could see it fit in the movie. the drop is cool. and em does his thing. Overall not bad, just doesnt really fit in w the album
You know what letting this one play out it actually is pretty dope


Overall: 8

~~Not a bad~~ a good album and his best hes put out in a while. You dont have to try to enjoy this one, there are some legitimate moments on this. Its lowkey crazy an Eminem sounds like this. Honestly stoked on Eminem again.

1st listen I absolutely hated it. I thought it was Kanyes worst album and was pissed that he wouldve thought this is okay. 
4th listen and I really like it now. This is by far Kanyes happiest album and I really enjoy how genuine kanye sounds on these songs. Yes some of the lyrics are really bad, Im not making any excuses for that. But as everyone has said the production is incredible and the features are great. I like it and think it will grow on me even more. Really positive vibes and attitude coming from kanye on this. Does it compare to MBDTF? Of course not but its not trying to be MBDTF and thats okay. 
###0###
***13628***
The title track Kids See Ghosts is excellent, but I'm just not feeling the other songs personally.
###0###
***4747***
I had nothing but negative expectations when seeing this album pop up...but I decided to give it a shot anyways. I'm pleasantly surprised. Most I've enjoyed an Eminem album since TES. Great selection of features -- Royce really stole the show for me in that aspect. Em's flows are pretty excellent from top to bottom. Beat selection is definitely modern, but still fits Em; really struck a nice balance with that.


There are many things I didn't like about the album - some of the hook's are weak, the usual corny Em punchlines, and the complaining about what other people think of him does get to a point where it's grating - but overall it's a really solid listen. Never thought in a million years that I would listen to an Eminem album in 2018 three times in a single day.

###1###

My first reaction has been this album sucks. Then I heard the last song and it seems like he's talking g to his daughter but as she's older. This album is from the future and the Kanye we've seen the past few weeks is really a replacement from the future sent back in time to save us and brought this album back with him.
###2###
***5522***
Kamikaze / Fall are for sure the high points of this album, it probably has some more, but I see those 2 tracks becoming the most popular of the album, maybe you could add Venom and Lucky You
###1###
***7137***
Jesus christ a lot of you people are so easily pleased. Most, not all, of this album is so samey same along with heaps of other music being released during this time period. When is some innovation going to come through this joint! I know im going to get downvoted but does anybody else agree?

FAR to early to call this the weakest. Take your rating of 808s and set the bar there for this one - subject matter and sonics all too similar to that, but they DO drift into MDBTF territory

I think if you're a Ye fan this is perfect. 

If not, it's okay. 

To me this album is what I've been waiting 2 years for.

It feels like this is the next step, and I love it.

Yeah after two listens nothing is really standing out aside from WHAT'S GOOD. There's so many ideas packed into each track but nothing really mixes well/makes artistic sense. 

The Yeezus comparisons are odd because each song on that album has a uniform idea and instrumental, very much unlike Igor

I've never been a huge Eminem fan but this album is so much better than the formulaic emo stadium-rap bullshit he's been releasing for the past ten years. Looks like it took him hitting rock bottom with Revival to wake the fuck up and release an album that sounds like he's actually part of the hiphop community and not stuck in a basement.

It's not perfect (Stepping Stone), but it's a massive step forward.

I know this is an unpopular opinion here, but Birds is Travis best album. Rodeo was amazing, had some great songs, but it also had a few bad tracks. Astroworld is also good, but has some bad tracks here and there. 

Birds did not have any bad songs imo. Every song on it goes.

 Expected this to be the best project out of Wyoming but I didnt expect Kanyes LYRICISM of all things to completely steal the show. This album has been on repeat all day.

This sounds like the soundtrack to an Adventure Time movie. 

Cool sounds definitely not something Ill play again because its not my style but I appreciate the fact Tyler has ventured out to make new music and not the same shit that works. Its like hearing Kanye in his prime when you didnt know which direction his music was going to go. This shit just too soft for me but if I was still in my acid and shroom stage Id fuck with this heavy

1. I love you Dwayne - i wasn't ready for this

2. Dont' Cry (ft. XXXTENTACION) - works so much better after the I love you Dwayne, it's good

3. Dedicate - yooooo that OBAMA SAMPLE at the end

4. Uproar - this goes hard af, soooo good - love this beat

5. Let it fly (ft. Travis Scott)- yee travis scott, awesome verse by lil wayne

6. Can't Be Broken - vintage sombre weezy

7. Dark Side of the Moon (ft. Nicki Minaj) - mood *picture of drake*. guilty pleasure is these sing rap songs, nicki singing is really good actually wouldn't have known it was her beside her name on the feature

8. Mona Lisa (ft. Kendrick Lamar) - chills. really wanted to skip to this one when I saw kendricks name ... but gotta listen to album in order on first playthrough
THIS IS IT , this is it. like it's namesake, masterpiece. when i thought it couldn't get better proved me wrong. fave song so far

9. What About Me (ft. Sosamann) -  good song for writing some sad poetry lmao, feels like the right spot to put it here after Mona Lisa

10. Open Letter - I want to like this more but not feeling it so much this time around, I think i gotta relisten to this one with lyrics handy

11. Famous (ft. Reginae Carter) - really enjoyable for me, reminds me of Em for some reason. "can't talk to myself cause mama said dont talk to strangers" 

12. Problems - one of my less enjoyed songs so far. couple lines i'll use ironically but prob a skip for me 

13. Dope Niggaz (ft. Snoop Dogg) - fantastic, loving this beat. OOOmg the switch, you'll know when

14. Hittas - its alright, prob skip for me. 

15. Took His Time - knew i was gonna like this about 2 seconds in. chorus so catchy, this would be so good live with a crowd

16. Open Safe - Bap, bap, bap, bap, I'm irate, nigga 5'5, stuntin' like I'm 5'8, nigga - lmaoo. i fuck with this its fun

17. Start This Shit Off Right (ft. Ashanti & Mack Maine) - ASHANTI!!! I liked this one straight away too

18. Demon - sooo smooth, sooo goood. so good, so good. "Asked the demon can we dance, Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past"

19. Mess - amazing track. got me fked up in a post-malone feel kinda way

20. Dope New Gospel (ft. Nivea) - really like the chorus, this feel of this one just hits me in the right ways

21. Perfect Strangers - damn ... what you play when u crying in the shower

22. Used 2 - finishing real strong here, ye love everything about this one. love love the beat, the flow, the tonality.

23. Let It All Work out - fk this is good, fantastic ending song. this going to repeat pile as well.

8.2-8.5/10 - really enjoyed the variety in sound here, felt like it dragged on but also felt like it finished too soon.

Overheard in the studio room while making Astroworld:

He got me, Travis Scott said of Cudi's moan and hum over Stop Trying to be God. "That f***ing Cudi boomed me."

Scott added, Hes so good, repeating it four times.

Scott then said he wanted to add Cudi to the list of rappers he wants to stroke his cactus with this summer.

Opinions on IGOR:

Only listened to the album once so opinions might change. However, for most of the album I was too distracted by him using that same god damn 808 bass from OKRA on like every fucking song. Also, kindve bummed he dumbed down some of the chordal complexity he was doing on flower boy. I see the vision, might need a couple more listens for it to click. Also a boy is a gun is a heater.

This motherfucker has the nerve to ruin a song featuring Justin Vernon with a line calling Tyler a faggot. 

I dont know. This is obviously better music at a technical and creatively inspired level than his recent output, but I think Ive just gotten tired of his schtick. His reinventions have been incredibly predictable and nothing has compelled me to dig in the way Relapse and before did. Maybe Im growing out of him, but this is just not doing it for me.

Half way through. Pleasantly surprised. Not crazy about Kendrick on Mona Lisa (not a big fan of the vocal affected character stuff). Not feeling Famous either...apart from that enjoyable

I like it a lot more than the stream, which I wasn't as sure about. It seems like a perfect mix of all the things Kanye has done so far. I'm getting used to the 7 track format, I think it's actually a good idea and somehow, after repeated listens, the short length seems perfect. Although it might be more of an EP than anything else. Still, whether its 20 minutes or 40 minutes its fire.

5 Songs in and I'm very pleased with this. I'm glad he made changes to A$AP Forever and gave Kid Cudi a verse as that greatly improved the track.

It feels spacious and big for something only 7 songs long. Production is tight. I really like it.
