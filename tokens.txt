first track is lebron talk to jr smith 

the album or buy each song individu for 

thi is real not sleep worth it 

ghost town outro about to be loop til time is no more 

lmao love how everi comment is either thi product is immacul and speak to me on spiritu level about mental ill or nigga what thi effortless trash that you yeezi should feel aw for defend 

disclaim thi is just my opinion ive enjoy read differ perspect on thi thread thi is just my humbl opinion with how much kany evolv with each album tend to go into each album not expect certain sound or characterist great lyric polit rap etc but tend to go expect cohes artist work and enjoy the experi as whole thi album make me so damn happi man mean as kany fan who want him to get better after hi breakdown and talk about hi medic struggl thi to me doesnt sound like old kany new kany it just sound like kany who wa found out some difficult truth about himself bi polar mental struggl but ha push through it ha learn to accept and love himself and is find joy and posit through just make hi music the album ha differ sound but one thing felt throughout is just an undeni joy for the gift of music tear up as the kick in over the moodi synth vocal effect in thought about kill you yike and all mine are such grin induc bop wouldnt leav is beauti with how ty dolla the choir and everyth build up at the end smile all throughout no mistak like damn charli wilson on that just had me grin like an idiot everyon alreadi mention it but ghost town is beauti it like some hip hop rock futurist mix and love it and violent crime is song know im go to think of if have daughter one day that is beauti stori and it good perspect hear ye as father how back when he releas onli one he wa so happi and in love with hi daughter but now at thi point he also struggl with the fear of how the world is go to tri to take advantag of hi daughter as she grow up sorri for write so much but man im on my listen and thi album make me happi polit tmz and all that asid with ye it good music as usual and couldnt be happier 

here is my fan boy analysi thought about kill you good intro track reminisc of tlop good vocal and dope switch up yike great beat that ye capit on with hard bar awesom track to follow up the intro fun catchi hook felt like walk from the green room to the stage all mine an interest beat support by dope featur ye lyric provid some clariti and comic relief to the heavi bass and strip down beat wouldnt leav thi messag is funni af but the song itself is good solid featur and hook exult horn and vocal apolog track apolog bar no mistak super rich luxuri hook that he strip down to give harder feel for the bar dope standard ye bar ghost town sorta reminisc of mbdtf and yeezu electr guitar sampl add to the drama that kid cudi start kany vocal are pretti good provid good contrast to cudi drawn out voic the bridg the featur is dope and further add to the epic and complex beat the random space sound in the background are kinda weird but ya know violent crime featur is good great exit song ye messag is solid bar are nice and uplift for the end of the album if onli it wa the lift yourself rework 

let me hit it raw fuck the outcom none of us would be here without cum thank kany 

where the all mine talk person favorit so far 

kany know about that 

wrap up my fourth listen and think it probabl kany worst album it not terribl or anyth but it just feel lack there are definit good song but the beat and back vocal are better than pretti much anyth kany rap know that can be the case for other kany stuff but the differ is starker on ye sometim it sound like he took element of tlop and just kinda made them more bore or mayb they seem bore becaus listen to tlop so much there isnt one song think is garbag like someth in pretti much all of them but at the same time there isnt one song ive listen to that click and just thought holi shit that amaz id give it about abov averag for anyon els below averag for kany 

listen to it earlier as fan of almost everyth kany ha put out so far im pretti disappoint 

think if your ye fan thi is perfect if not it okay to me thi album is what ive been wait year for tlop and more ha gotten me through so much late it feel like thi is the next step and love it 

thi album got hhh feel bipolar as well peopl either call it top ye album or call it hi worst lol 

can we talk about the scream at the end of yike 

know thi is unrel to the album per se but ye did drop when he told us if na doe drop in june im go to lose my shit 

after listen im realli like it the short of the album and some of the song make it hard to compar to hi other album so thi album is sort of just in categori of it own 

great product and lot of struggl bar seem to be hi new formula 

album wasnt good or intrigu at all some good moment but overal disappoint 

thought kany would eventu stop talk about fuck women the way he doe after he got marri 

thi album is kany weakest till date but all see is peopl on twitter and in here call it classic someon help me 

ive listen to thi few time now it alreadi grow on me did the same with daytona though like that instantli these minut album are great idea for such work wouldnt blame peopl for ask for new materi sooner though 

also find it interest thi album is like or like on here and like like on twitter normal that goe complet the opposit direct 

violent crime is heavenli wonder what it could sound like on remix though 

thi feel like ye most relax album yet 

instrument are fire as alway top to bottom realli fuck with the first two track definit wa hit on that therapeut vibe that he mention in the charlamagn interview wouldnt leav is probabl the weakest point for me ive list to the album time sinc the initi stream and that track is alreadi an automat skip for me not that it bad song per se just not my cup of tea at all charli wilson kill the hook on no mistak though wish there wa anoth vers from ye the slick rick sampl just add whole new dimens to the song shake stole the show on ghost town probabl my favorit featur on the whole project the rest of the track is kind of forgett compar to the end im not huge fan of violent crime but think they definit execut on the idea of the song veri well the voic mail from nicki at the end wa kind of cool wa expect more actual rap again he allud to real friend as the type of vibe they would be hit on thi albumkind of got that music but it certainli not that from rap standpoint still enjoy daytona lot more but thi is solid album kany realli had to thread the needl with thi onebar ani room for error on seven track album it kind of all over the place but suppos that to be expect given all of themesidea he wa tri to hit on deal with mental ill hi recent antic etc 

readi for the downvot but imo thi is kany weakest album and while the product wa nice the lyric were disappoint realli dont think well ever see the level of bar yeezi use to be capabl of kept wait for some peak that never came smh 

enjoy yourself new ye album releas are special and not to be taken fro grant 

enjoy it 

cant believ hate ye like week ago 

been stress the fuck out late got lot on my mind lot of it my own fault lot of it my own issu that need to deal with and for me thi album realli brought out genuin smile and made me feel amaz when realli fuck need it that mean more to me than banger ever will nobodi els ha to feel the same way but for me stuff like thi is whi stan kany hi music ha made profound impact in my life in some dark time thi isnt ani differ anyway much love yall have good day 

ghost town is get me hype for the kayn and cudi colab 

ani one catch that dmt line make you wonder if the psychedel got ye woke af 

mix bag lyric with some realli nice product to complement kany most recent releas come just about year after the life of pablo thi album had veri odd method of releas be stream on an obscur live stream app complet with video of hi listen parti in wyom where he play through the album twice hate it at first which may have had someth to do with the fact that wa watch it with friend and he also didnt like it but today listen to the releas on spotifi and there wa lot of good as well as lot of bad the product on thi album is overal realli neat it use lot of old soul sampl ie thi one from ghost town it fit the mood of the album realli well in my opinion although do have gripe with how obnoxi the slick rick sampl is place on no mistak if youv heard it youll know exactli what im talk about other than that though product is realli good kany himself is fine as far as flow goe but as for lyric it mix bag to say the least you go from realli interest look into hi mental state in the spoken word segment of thought about kill you to the revivallevel garbag on all mine ie love your titti caus they prove can focu on two thing at onc let me hit it raw like fuck the outcom ayi none of us would be here without cum to name few there lot of that backandforth on thi album but when he hit he realli hit the last track on thi album violent crime legitim made me cri when realli took time to listen to it so if noth els is gain in listen to thi album we know that kany is still capabl of make great track overal im realli glad gave thi album anoth chanc wish that he had been more consist lyric but at least he seem to be trend in the right direct let hope kid see ghost and kany futur solo effort turn out just as good hope better 

listen in it get even more flame 

hillari and the dnc rig the primari against berni 

fam im honestli scare for ye thi album sound like suicid note god fuck hope not if you read thi ye plz we need you bro true artist out here shape shit mayb im just noid but fuck first track thought about kill you he blatantli state he thought about kill himself violent crime like goodby song to north edit north not saint

no wonder jay drop him from the team 

so far it ha definit grown on me after multipl listen but there is clearli someth miss peopl here are prais the product as the best product theyv ever heard what some song sound good product but other are purpos full of restraint thi clearli wasnt an album where kany wa overli innov or mastur in hi product he seem to play it lot more mellow here and that on purpos it okay we dont need to pretend it the greatest produc thing ever daytona had way more uniqu and power product and im not just say that becaus daytona is full of banger and ye is more mellow with rap some of the bar are fun but kany vers on what would meek do flow better than anyth here the album actual shine the most with the featur vocal exclud cudi sadli just isnt real good sing thi all said realli like song where are more of grower it pretti album with some beauti moment but it held back by moment that are just plain underwhelm also the album cover it straight up minion quot and wyom is beauti but the meme that he took it on hi iphon isnt as impress if it would have been better expos photo

thi album put me through so mani emot in good way like the time listen to my beauti dark twist fantasi impress for me is that thi album is might chang somewher down the line but wow 

mayb it will grow on me but honestli most of these track arent realli stick with me that much most of the album kinda blur into one not in the good way wa realli excit which might be part of whi dont like it much sinc my expect were high feel as if the album style burn out realli fast and just cant realli manag minut album sinc on an individu level like fair few song here but they are quit similar 

like tyler sing voic dont know whi peopl think it so bad 

yeah after two listen noth is realli stand out asid from what good there so mani idea pack into each track but noth realli mix wellmak artist sens the yeezu comparison are odd becaus each song on that album ha uniform idea and instrument veri much unlik igor 

it start well but get bore quick 

the product is insan as per tyler usual but cant help but think some of these song would be so much better with other peopl sing 

name the album igor becaus greatest hit sound bore 

first track ha heavi yeezu vibe especi on sight 

lil uzi vert it kali uchi 

fuck spotifi 

first listen it wa littl underwhelm to me 

the product is fantast but hi vocal are terribl whi are they mix so low too

album sound weird but like it tyler realli come through with the product 

lawd we parti 

thi sound like the soundtrack to an adventur time movi cool sound definit not someth ill play again becaus it not my style but appreci the fact tyler ha ventur out to make new music and not the same shit that work it like hear kany in hi prime when you didnt know which direct hi music wa go to go thi shit just too soft for me but if wa still in my acid and shroom stage id fuck with thi heavi 

opinion on igor onli listen to the album onc so opinion might chang howev for most of the album wa too distract by him use that same god damn bass from okra on like everi fuck song also kindv bum he dumb down some of the chordal complex he wa do on flower boy see the vision might need coupl more listen for it to click also boy is gun is heater 

definit what direct he wa go with for the album and im enjoy it veri much not rap album but hi take on altern rb and antipop 

nice 

damn dont normal fw tyler but thi slap that frank ocean featur on run out of time surpris me 

im just lowkey sad there aint rex orang counti featur the one on flowerboy slap 

what with the vinyl crackl on track and found it realli distract 

classic 

thi is more of an experi than an album it clearli draw from pharrel artist and audibl there is certain lack of structur which make it great 

hate to say it caus im tyler fan but thi absolut trash no rap like at all would it kill him to put potato salad or tron cat type song on here
